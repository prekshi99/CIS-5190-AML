This repository contains:

• A custom deep learning architecture for Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie reviews, leveraging LSTM layers with GloVe embeddings for textual data.

• A custom CNN architecture with advanced preprocessing techniques, including normalization, Gaussian blur, and dataset shifts via augmentation (rotation, cropping, brightness) for image classfication

• Benchmarking has also been done for the the traditional ML models like Softmax Regression, Adaboost, XGBoost and Random Forest.
